# ShuffleNet
An implementation of `ShuffleNet` introduced in TensorFlow. According to the authors, `ShuffleNet` is a computationally efficient CNN architecture designed specifically for mobile devices with very limited computing power. It outperforms `Google MobileNet` by
small error percentage at much lower FLOPs.
